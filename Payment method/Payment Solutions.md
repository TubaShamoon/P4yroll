## Payment Solution Suggestion
We have multiple options.

1: We can open a subsidiary of Reveltek in Pakistan and opening a bank account with that name, which will handle the employee's salary.

2: We can open a small new tech company here in Pakistan and we will show like this paki company is getting projects from Reveltek and paying to employees for their project services.

## Risk on sending the individual banks 
With the current method, we can face an issue while distribution of money. It will come under the face of Tax department. Payroll people cannot prove it to tax department.

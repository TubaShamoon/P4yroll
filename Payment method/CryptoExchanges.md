- They need a crypto exchange in order to deposit the funds like Binance, Kraken,CEX etc
## 1inch wallet
- 1inch is not a wallet or exchange either, but rather a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator.
- It searches multiple decentralized exchanges for the best prices and liquidity, allowing users to make trades across different DEX platforms.
- It provides users with the ability to swap cryptocurrencies at the most favorable rates available on the decentralized market.
